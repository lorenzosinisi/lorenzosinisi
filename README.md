Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
my name is Lorenzo Sinisi and I am working as Freelance Software Developer based in Berlin.

Designed in Italy and assembled in Berlin. *Not yet tested in German language, but I'm working on updating it!*

**Background**
---


Developing software since 2005, went from PHP + jQuery to Ruby and React until 
recently landing on Elixir and a particular interested for distributed scalable 
systems and computational logic.


**Current work**

Currently working on helping companies scale they business adopting technologies that
work at scale (i.e. going from startup mode to big tv advertisement on prime time) 

Technologies I love:
- EventSourcing and CQRS in Elixir
- JSON APIs via HTTP
- Expert systems and AI
- DSL and parsers built in Elixir/Erlang
- Phoenix framework
- Websocket connections
- Javascript and React (saga, redux, reselect, webpack)
- gRPC
- Ruby


**Philosophy**

- We code for human, not machines
- Make it work then make it readable
